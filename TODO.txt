Todo


1) Rewrite Route function to accept 'Action' key.
2) Rewrite Routing for a cleaner URI
3) Remove Endpoint, create a View folder for all admin/public files instead
4) Add middleware
5) Create documentation for Route -> Request -> Controller -> View


Implement a new Routing
- Removing endpoints, endpoint should be defined in the views instead.
- Add middleware checking
- add resource checking, each routes are resource routes already
- Implement a new way of routing
